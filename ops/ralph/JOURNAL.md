# Ralph loop — JOURNAL (append-only; newest at the bottom)

The loop appends ONE entry per successful iteration. `ops/ralph/updates.sh` reports
everything here (and every commit) since the last time you asked. Format per entry:

```
## <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM> — <short title>
- built: <what, and why it matters>
- tests: <suites run> -> <pass/fail>
- build: nixos-rebuild build -> <ok/fail>
- files: <paths>
- commit: <hash>
- next: <suggested follow-up>
```

## 2026-09-23 — loop scaffolding seeded (by the setup session, not the loop)
- built: ops/ralph/ guardrails, prompt, plan, journal, updates reporter — the
  harness the autonomous loop runs inside.
- next: install the ralph plugin, launch the loop on branch ralph/auto.

## 2026-09-23 18:40 — A1: jv-hud Quickshell skeleton
- built: `shell/jv-hud/shell.qml` — the first piece of the face (blueprint §06).
  One Wayland layer-shell surface per connected monitor, and it renders nothing:
  no bus subscription exists yet, so there is nothing truthful to display, and
  §06's default state is your work and nothing else. Invariant 10 is enforced by
  construction, not by comment: `WlrKeyboardFocus.None` + `focusable:false` (the
  surface cannot take the keyboard), `ExclusionMode.Ignore` (zero exclusive zone —
  no window is resized around it), `mask: Region {}` (empty input region, clicks
  pass through), `WlrLayer.Top` (over windows, yields to fullscreen/lock), and
  `visible:false` until something real arrives — an unmapped surface is 0 fps.
  `JV_HUD_SELFTEST=1 jv-hud` maps a small marker that reports only that the SHELL
  loaded; it never stands in for a sensor. Packaged as `.#jv-hud` (QML copied to
  the store + wrapped quickshell 0.3.0) and installed system-wide, with a user
  unit that is intentionally NOT in `default.target.wants` — a resident, empty
  overlay is exactly the set dressing §06 forbids.
- tests: no Python/Rust touched, so `runtests.sh` was not applicable. The gate for
  QML is qmllint inside the package's checkPhase, run with `-W 0` (any warning
  fails; `uncreatable-type` disabled because every quickshell window type is
  registered non-creatable upstream). Verified the gate is real by appending a
  syntax error to shell.qml: `nix build .#jv-hud` FAILED as it should, then passed
  again once reverted.
- build: `nix build .#jv-hud` -> ok · `nixos-rebuild build --flake .#ares` -> ok
  (checked the result: `etc/systemd/user/jv-hud.service` exists and is absent from
  `default.target.wants`, as intended).
- files: shell/jv-hud/shell.qml, shell/jv-hud/README.md, pkgs/jv-hud/default.nix,
  flake.nix, modules/jarvis-services.nix
- commit: 49046db
- next: A2 — a `Theme` QML singleton holding the §06 tokens (ground #090D12/#0C1116,
  ember #F0714A, teal #4FB8BF, text tiers), sourced from `personality/theme.toml`
  so the look is versioned with the voice and the wake word. Then A5 (the
  consumer-only bus bridge) before A3, since A3 needs real frames to exist.
  Note for A2/A3: quickshell's `margins` grouped property has no resolvable type
  in its qmltypes — use inner-item anchors margins, or the lint gate trips.

## 2026-09-24 — A2: theme tokens live in personality/, the HUD only consumes them
- built: `personality/theme.toml` — the blueprint §06 palette, type, motion and
  geometry tokens, versioned beside `voice.toml` and `system.md` because a theme
  is identity (invariant 9), and `tools/gen_theme_qml.py`, which compiles it into
  `shell/jv-hud/Theme.qml` (a `pragma Singleton`) plus the `qmldir` that makes
  `import "."` resolve. `shell.qml` now carries no colour of its own: ground,
  ember, radius, inset, font and tracking all come from `Theme`. The point is
  that "why is it that colour?" is answered by one diffable file, and that
  jv-dream can propose a look the way it proposes a voice — as a patch a human
  reads. Four gates keep it honest, and each one was checked by breaking it:
  (1) `--check` runs in jv-hud's checkPhase before qmllint, so a Theme.qml that
  has drifted from the toml cannot be built — verified by flipping ember to
  #FF00FF, watching `nix build .#jv-hud` fail with "stale generated files", and
  restoring; (2) qmllint type-checks token access through the singleton —
  `Theme.doesNotExist` is `missing-property`, a build failure, not a silently
  transparent rectangle at runtime; (3) a test forbids a literal `"#RRGGBB"` in
  any QML file but the generated one — it caught shell.qml's three hardcoded
  colours, which is what drove this change into shell.qml rather than leaving the
  singleton unused; (4) a test parses `docs/blueprint.html`'s dark `:root` block
  and asserts all 15 tokens still equal it, so the theme cannot wander off from
  the design it came from. theme.toml is also /etc-deployed with the rest of
  personality/ — nothing reads it at runtime (the HUD's copy is compiled in), but
  the whole of what Jarvis is should be readable in one directory on the machine.
- tests: `bash ops/ralph/runtests.sh tools` -> 16 passed (new suite:
  tools/tests/test_gen_theme_qml.py). Written first and run red — the generator
  did not exist, then the colour-literal test failed alone until shell.qml
  consumed the singleton.
- build: `nix build .#jv-hud` -> ok (Theme.qml + qmldir land in the store beside
  shell.qml) · `nixos-rebuild build --flake .#ares` -> ok, and
  `result/etc/jarvis/personality/theme.toml` is present. Never test/switch.
- files: personality/theme.toml, tools/gen_theme_qml.py,
  tools/tests/test_gen_theme_qml.py, shell/jv-hud/Theme.qml, shell/jv-hud/qmldir,
  shell/jv-hud/shell.qml, shell/jv-hud/README.md, pkgs/jv-hud/default.nix,
  modules/jarvis-services.nix, ops/ralph/PLAN.md
- commit: 6c0eafb
- next: A5 — the consumer-only bus bridge for QML (a small client that subscribes
  to the Unix socket and exposes frames as QML properties, never importing another
  service), because A3 has nothing truthful to display until real frames exist.
  Two follow-ups fell out of this one and are in PLAN.md: A7 (a single
  `prefers-reduced-motion` switch + `Theme.easeMs` Behavior, so the first moving
  pixel already obeys §06) and A8 (Archivo + JetBrains Mono are named in
  theme.toml but not declared in `fonts.packages` — a missing font is a silent
  change of look).
