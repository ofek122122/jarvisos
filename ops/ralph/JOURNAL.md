# Ralph loop — JOURNAL (append-only; newest at the bottom)

The loop appends ONE entry per successful iteration. `ops/ralph/updates.sh` reports
everything here (and every commit) since the last time you asked. Format per entry:

```
## <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM> — <short title>
- built: <what, and why it matters>
- tests: <suites run> -> <pass/fail>
- build: nixos-rebuild build -> <ok/fail>
- files: <paths>
- commit: <hash>
- next: <suggested follow-up>
```

## 2026-09-23 — loop scaffolding seeded (by the setup session, not the loop)
- built: ops/ralph/ guardrails, prompt, plan, journal, updates reporter — the
  harness the autonomous loop runs inside.
- next: install the ralph plugin, launch the loop on branch ralph/auto.
