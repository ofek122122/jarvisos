# Ralph loop — JOURNAL (append-only; newest at the bottom)

The loop appends ONE entry per successful iteration. `ops/ralph/updates.sh` reports
everything here (and every commit) since the last time you asked. Format per entry:

```
## <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM> — <short title>
- built: <what, and why it matters>
- tests: <suites run> -> <pass/fail>
- build: nixos-rebuild build -> <ok/fail>
- files: <paths>
- commit: <hash>
- next: <suggested follow-up>
```

## 2026-09-23 — loop scaffolding seeded (by the setup session, not the loop)
- built: ops/ralph/ guardrails, prompt, plan, journal, updates reporter — the
  harness the autonomous loop runs inside.
- next: install the ralph plugin, launch the loop on branch ralph/auto.

## 2026-09-23 18:40 — A1: jv-hud Quickshell skeleton
- built: `shell/jv-hud/shell.qml` — the first piece of the face (blueprint §06).
  One Wayland layer-shell surface per connected monitor, and it renders nothing:
  no bus subscription exists yet, so there is nothing truthful to display, and
  §06's default state is your work and nothing else. Invariant 10 is enforced by
  construction, not by comment: `WlrKeyboardFocus.None` + `focusable:false` (the
  surface cannot take the keyboard), `ExclusionMode.Ignore` (zero exclusive zone —
  no window is resized around it), `mask: Region {}` (empty input region, clicks
  pass through), `WlrLayer.Top` (over windows, yields to fullscreen/lock), and
  `visible:false` until something real arrives — an unmapped surface is 0 fps.
  `JV_HUD_SELFTEST=1 jv-hud` maps a small marker that reports only that the SHELL
  loaded; it never stands in for a sensor. Packaged as `.#jv-hud` (QML copied to
  the store + wrapped quickshell 0.3.0) and installed system-wide, with a user
  unit that is intentionally NOT in `default.target.wants` — a resident, empty
  overlay is exactly the set dressing §06 forbids.
- tests: no Python/Rust touched, so `runtests.sh` was not applicable. The gate for
  QML is qmllint inside the package's checkPhase, run with `-W 0` (any warning
  fails; `uncreatable-type` disabled because every quickshell window type is
  registered non-creatable upstream). Verified the gate is real by appending a
  syntax error to shell.qml: `nix build .#jv-hud` FAILED as it should, then passed
  again once reverted.
- build: `nix build .#jv-hud` -> ok · `nixos-rebuild build --flake .#ares` -> ok
  (checked the result: `etc/systemd/user/jv-hud.service` exists and is absent from
  `default.target.wants`, as intended).
- files: shell/jv-hud/shell.qml, shell/jv-hud/README.md, pkgs/jv-hud/default.nix,
  flake.nix, modules/jarvis-services.nix
- commit: 49046db
- next: A2 — a `Theme` QML singleton holding the §06 tokens (ground #090D12/#0C1116,
  ember #F0714A, teal #4FB8BF, text tiers), sourced from `personality/theme.toml`
  so the look is versioned with the voice and the wake word. Then A5 (the
  consumer-only bus bridge) before A3, since A3 needs real frames to exist.
  Note for A2/A3: quickshell's `margins` grouped property has no resolvable type
  in its qmltypes — use inner-item anchors margins, or the lint gate trips.
